istar-website-test-v0.1

Introduction for cooperation hi! I am Tianjin, the guy you have known, I am here to introduce the git, the standard and modern framework for coding cooperation. 
Pick up this tool would let us work as a close and professional team. On this project, we would use git and docker to convey the correction and the code we build. 
The only thing Git can convey is JUST pure text such as code! You can't test it immediately. It can't transfer the software and background set so you have to install them by yourself then anyway.
If you want to test in your own computer, we need docker, you need to sign in the DockerHub and I would transfer the whole subject to you. Be aware of the requirement! 
Check out the README text when you get a subject and if you make any correction, remember to record in the README text. 
By the way, remember that if you make your own correction, you need to submit it to Github or Dockerhub and remind us in our WeChat group.
